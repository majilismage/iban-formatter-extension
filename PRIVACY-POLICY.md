# IBANify: Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how IBANify ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles information when you use our Chrome browser extension.

## Information Collection and Use

IBANify is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **No Data Collection**: IBANify does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data.
- **Local Processing Only**: All IBAN detection, validation, and formatting occurs entirely on your device. No data is sent to external servers.
- **No User Tracking**: We do not use cookies, analytics, or tracking mechanisms of any kind.

## Permissions

IBANify requires certain permissions to function:

- **Context Menu Integration**: To provide the right-click "Format IBAN" option
- **Clipboard Access**: To copy formatted IBANs to your clipboard when requested
- **Page Content Access**: To detect and process IBANs on webpages you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and never for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

IBANify does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs.

## Data Security

Since no user data is collected, stored, or transmitted, there are no data security concerns related to server storage or data breaches.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the extension.
